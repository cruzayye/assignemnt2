# ASSIGNMENT 04

### How did I group my functions to avoid DRY code
Line 20 defines the trueFalse function which has 3 paremeters: 
First one targets the <p> tag where our innrHTML will be places.
Second Parameter lets us put in whatever message we want such as "correct/wrong".
Third Parameter defines the class style which will be applied to the second parameter. 

### Where do is an ARRAY integrated?
Second function line 60. 

### What do i still need to work on?
1.Integrating a for loop to compare the value to the array.
2. Seems like theres still some repetitive code that can be condensed.
